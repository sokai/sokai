# Giving up GitHub

I believe open source communities should prefer open source tools. I also believe that maintainers need protection from AI slop, while GitHub actively builds tools that are drowning us in it. Therefore, I am [giving up GitHub][give-up-github] for personal use, but keep _[using it][github-sokai]_ for contribs @GH (only).

## Codeberg

[Codeberg][codeberg] is _[my home][codeberg-sokai]_ for collaborative open source.  Most new projects will be started there, and I am migrating established projects as I can.

## Forgejo

I self-host [Forgejo][forgejo] for projects where contributions are not anticipated.  It also mirrors several open source projects I have associated with.  You are welcome to [explore][explore-forgejo].
