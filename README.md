# Giving up GitHub

I believe open source communities should prefer open source tools.  I also believe that maintainers need protection from AI slop, while GitHub actively builds tools that are drowning us in it.  Therefore, I am [giving up GitHub][give-up-github] for personal use.

## Codeberg

<dfn>[Codeberg][codeberg]</dfn> is <dfn>[my home][codeberg-sokai]</dfn> for collaborative open source.  Most new projects will be started there, and I am migrating established projects as I can.

> [!TIP]
> [Get started][codeberg-get-started] with Codeberg.

## Forgejo

I self-host <dfn>[Forgejo][forgejo]</dfn> for projects where contributions are not anticipated.  It also mirrors several open source projects I have associated with.  You are welcome to [explore][explore-forgejo].

## Vestiges

This GitHub account remains active for work and for open source that is not mine to move.
